The creative and technical logistics that go into building today\'s hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Jason Schreier takes readers on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius. Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-sized monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisypheanâ€”it\'s nothing short of miraculous.Taking some of the most popular, bestselling recent games, Schreier immerses readers in the hellfire of the development process, whether it\'s RPG studio Bioware\'s challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build Dragon Age: Inquisition, indie developer Eric Barone\'s single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG Stardew Valley from one man\'s vision into a multi-million-dollar franchise, or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create Destiny, a brand new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as Star Wars and Lord of the Ringsâ€”even as it nearly ripped their studio apart. Documenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels is a journey through development hellâ€”and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable.','HarperCollins',304,'Games , Activities , Video , Electronic','English','Sep 5, 2017'),(9,'Twas The Nightshift Before Christmas: Festive hospital diaries from the author of million-copy hit This is Going to Hurt','Adam Kay',4.7,47,41.82,'A short gift book of festive hospital diaries from the author of million-copy bestseller This is Going to HurtChristmas is coming, the goose is getting fat . . . but 1.4 million NHS staff are heading off to work.

Brett surged to the front rank of contemporary fantasy, standing alongside giants in the field such as George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks. The Daylight War, the eagerly anticipated third volume in Brettâ€™s internationally bestselling Demon Cycle, continues the epic tale of humanityâ€™s last stand against an army of demons that rise each night to prey on mankind.\n\n On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.\n\n Arlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something moreâ€”the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but Arlenâ€™s path threatens to lead to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.\n\n The only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.\n\n Ahmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself Sharâ€™Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weaponsâ€”a spear and a crownâ€”that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.\n\n But Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. Ineveraâ€™s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.\n\n Once Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanityâ€™s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of allâ€”those lurking in the human heart.\n\nLook for Peter V.

He was accused of killing Keith Russo, a lawyer in a small Florida town. But there were no reliable witnesses and little motive. Just the fact that Russo had botched Quincy\'s divorce case, that Quincy was black in a largely all-white town and that a blood-splattered torch was found in the boot of Quincy\'s car. A torch he swore was planted. A torch that was conveniently destroyed in a fire just before his trial. The lack of evidence made no difference to judge or jury. In the eyes of the law Quincy was guilty and, no matter how often he protested his innocence, his punishment was life in prison. Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them.

Porterâ€™s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America.\n\nBased on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porterâ€™s â€œdiamond,â€ a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter\'s concept of â€œclusters,â€ or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy.\n \nEven before publication of the book, Porterâ€™s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere.

But that\'s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness - from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-helpâ€™s suggested routes to happiness and success â€“ such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals â€“ can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety. Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that â€˜everythingâ€™s fineâ€™ even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily._______PRAISE FOR HAPPY:\n\"\"Crammed with wisdom and insight . . .

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\'t. The Findings\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.â€œSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,â€ comments Jim Collins, \"\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.â€ Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\"','Harper Collins',320,'Business , Economics , Management','English','Jul 19, 2011'),(77,'How to Understand Business Finance: Edition 2','Bob Cinnamon',3.5,4,46.85,'The modern marketplace is increasingly unpredictable and there is an ever-greater need for non-financial managers to understand the financial and management accounting process.How to Understand Business Finance is part of the bestselling Creating Success series published in association with the Sunday Times, which has been translated into 25 languages with over 500, 000 copies sold.

I tell wee stories. And some of them don\'t even have punchlines. But you\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.','Hachette UK',336,'Humor , General','English','Oct 17, 2019'),(124,'Antiques Con','Barbara Allan',4.8,4,29.9,'\"\"\"Endlessly amusing.\"\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\nSmall-town sleuths Brandy and Vivian Borne--with their trusty shih tzu, Sushi--head for a Big Apple comics convention to sell a rare 1940s Superman drawing.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazineâ€™s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewaterâ€™s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as â€œan idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.â€ It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalioâ€”who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhoodâ€”that he believes are the reason behind his success.\n \n In Principles, Dalio shares what heâ€™s learned over the course of his remarkable career.

She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame.

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.\n\nFleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerysâ€™s claim to Westeros forever.\n\nMeanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stoneâ€”a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Nightâ€™s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.\n\nFrom all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness.

I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\n\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\n\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\n\nMy suspicions were correct.\n\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\'ve been doing it all wrong.\n\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\'t giving you great results.\n\nMost popular strategies don\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\'s only when you start playing by your brain\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\n\nWhat\'s A Mini Habit?\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day, its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\'re always moving forward.\n\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\n\nAim For The First Step\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.Â \n\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\'ll still get somewhere. I\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\'t do anything because it\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\n\nI\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\n\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\'s how our brains are designed to change.\n\nNote:Â This book isn\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\n\nLasting change won\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works.

After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management. This 2nd edition contains major updates on BPMN Version 2 process orchestration and process choreographies, and the chapter on BPM methodologies has been completely rewritten.

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud\'s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious.\"','e-artnow',160,'Psychology , Movements , Psychoanalysis','English','Feb 8, 2016'),(476,'Darksiders: The Abomination Vault: A Novel','Ari Marmell',4.5,485,57.3,'\"Ride with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse as they seek to unearth a plot that could plunge all of Creation into chaos!\n Â \n Ages before the events of Darksiders and Darksiders II, two of the feared Horsemenâ€”Death and Warâ€”are tasked with stopping a group of renegades from locating the Abomination Vault: a hoard containing weapons of ultimate power and malice, capable of bringing an end to the uneasy truce between Heaven and Hell . . . but only by unleashing total destruction.\n Â \n Created in close collaboration with the Darksiders II teams at Vigil and THQ, Darksiders: The Abomination Vault gives an exciting look at the history and world of the Horsemen, shining a new light on the unbreakable bond between War and Death.\"','Del Rey',368,'Fiction , Fairy Tales, Folk Tales, Legends , Mythology','English','Jul 24, 2012'),(477,'The Secrets of Saving and Investing with Alvin Hall: Simple Strategies to Make Your Money Go Further','Alvin Hall',3.7,23,3.9,'The most popular question Alvin Hall is asked is \'where does my money go?\'.

The Art of War By Sun Tzu translated and commented on by Lionel Giles, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, The Art of War by NiccolÃ² Machiavelli, and The Art of War by Baron De Jomini. These four books will give you as complete a view on the art of war as you can attain. This is the most important book ever written about warfare and conflict. Lionel Giles\' translation is the definitive edition and his commentary is indispensable. The Art of War can be used and adapted in every facet of your life. This book explains when and how to go to war, as well as when not to. Learn how to win any conflict whether it be on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Although Carl von Clausewitz participated in many military campaigns, he was primarily a military theorist interested in the examination of war. On War is the West\'s premier work on the philosophy of war. Other soldiers before him had written treatises on various military subjects, but none undertook a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clausewitz\'s. On War is considered to be the first modern book of military strategy. This is due mainly to Clausewitz\' integration of political, social, and economic issues as some of the most important factors in deciding the outcomes of a war. It is one of the most important treatises on strategy ever written, and continues to be required reading at many military academies. Niccolo Machiavelli considered this book his greatest achievement. Here you will learn how to recruit, train, motivate, and discipline an army. You will learn the difference between strategy and tactics. Machiavelli does a masterful job of breaking down and analyzing historic battles. This book of military knowledge belongs alongside Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz on every book shelf. Antoine-Henri Jomini was the most celebrated writer on the Napoleonic art of war. Jomini was present at most of the most important battles of the Napoleonic Wars. His writing, therefore, is the most authoritative on the subject. \"\"The art of war, as generally considered, consists of five purely military branches,-viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, and Tactics. A sixth and essential branch, hitherto unrecognized, might be termed Diplomacy in its relation to War. Although this branch is more naturally and intimately connected with the profession of a statesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be denied that, if it be useless to a subordinate general, it is indispensable to every general commanding an army.\"\" -Antoine-Henri Jomini\"','Simon and Schuster',667,'Political Science , Political Ideologies , General','English','Apr 29, 2013'),(760,'Wrecking Ball (Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book 14)','Jeff Kinney',4.7,166,53.11,'\"In Wrecking Ball, Book 14 of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid seriesâ€”from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinneyâ€”an unexpected inheritance gives Greg Heffleyâ€™s family a chance to make big changes to their house.

But when Ryan goes silent, Gina is shocked to discover the young woman has died tragically in a Jet Ski accident while on holiday.\n\n Meanwhile, REL counsel Michael Carter finds himself in a tricky spot.
